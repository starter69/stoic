#Something here isn't working due to the has_many through relationship and setting up of the Factory... there is a blog post at http://nepalonrails.com/blog/2014/09/factory-girl-traits-and-list-for-has-many-through-relation that shows an example of how it should work... otherwise just google "has many through FactoryGirl" and there are lots of solutions. I am tired now, I think I am just doing something small wrong here... It really should just work out of the box. I mean it is just a has_many through relationship and FactoryGirl through its advanced associations should just be able to test that normally.
