## What is Stoic Penknife?
Stoic Penknife (https://www.stoicpenknife.com) is a web application to practice **ancient Stoic philosophical 'think-exercises'** to question your perceptions about yourself and your life. **Marcus Aurelius**, **Seneca**, **Epictetus** and other ancient Greek + Roman philosophers once practiced these exercises on paper - now you can do it with an app! Amazing.

## How is the Application Organized?
* Rails Active Record Backend
* Bootstrap Views with HAML + JQuery
* 2 Admins - Custom Admin (Managed with CanCanCan Gem) plus an Active Admin

The Custom CanCanCan Admin is for managing exercises, doctrines and quotations. The Active Record Admin is for managing users. In the future I would love to combine them. There is no reason to have two separate Admins.

## Test Coverage
Stoic Penknife uses RSpec's new System Specs to test all key integrated user actions. I also have controller specs for the Exercise controller, the most important controller. All the key models are covered.

I use `CodeCov` to monitor Test Coverage: https://codecov.io/gh/Henryvw/stoic_penknife

The exception to Stoic Penknife's test coverage (the reason it is not 100% covered) is the Active Admin backend. This Admin is not relevant to the user experience and I have not written tests for it. Again, should I combine the two Admins into one, I would start by writing a new 'Admin' test suite.

## Hosting + Deployment
I use CircleCI to run the Rubocop linter and the full test suite, push to CodeCov and and manage deployment to the production Heroku instance: https://github.com/Henryvw/stoic_penknife/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml

## How Can I Contribute?
Stoic Penknife is an open source project. If you are interested in contributing please write to me, Henry, at henry@stoicpenknife.com. We have a list of tasks in the Project tab. We would also love to hear about additional improvement ideas. You are also free to fork the project and to make your own version (perhaps an Epicurean, Platonic-Academic, Aristotlean-Peripatetic, Pyrrho-Skeptic, Eclectic, Diogenes-Cynic or Heraklitean version?!)

## How Can I Use the App?
To practice ancient Stoic philosophical 'think-exercises' and to create your own custom 'think-exercises', visit the production instance at https://www.stoicpenknife.com.

## Play with the App locally
If you want to play around, simply download the app and make sure you have Rails 5.2.3 and Ruby 2.6.2 installed and spin her up - `rails s`.

I still have not written a seed file for the database. You will need to manually create a User with admin=true in Rails Console in order to administer global exercises. 

The second, ActiveAdmin back-end you can access at `/admin`. At the present time this also requires a Rails Console-manually-created separate, Active Admin user created using the `AdminUser` model.
